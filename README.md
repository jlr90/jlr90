# My profile site

This is was created for the subject *Introduction to Information Technology* at RMIT University.

### Layout

I chose to display this website entirely on a single page, rather than spread across multiple pages.
The static navbar at the top allows for easy navigation to different sections.
Sections are also separated by clear headers and alternating color palettes.
The HTML smoothscroll feature (Not supported by Safari) allows for a visually appealing transition if using the navbar to navigate the site.

I decided to group the **personal information** and **personal profile** components into one **About Me** section, as they have a similar theme.
Adding flipcards for the personality test results and sub headers for the analysis allowed me to break up the information in a nice way.

### Technicals

In order to be time efficient and focus more on the aesthetics and content, I chose to use **Bootstrap 4** for the layout. The site is completely mobile responsive, including a collapsable navbar.

### Side note

I have set up this GitHub account (jlr90) to use specifically for RMIT related projects. As I already have another GitHub account (JackLangdon), I had to set up my computer in a way that I could contribute to both accounts without difficulty.

Due to this situation, the contributions to this repository have been recorded as being made from my alternate account.
