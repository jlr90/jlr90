            Hi! My name’s John and I’m from Melbourne, Australia. I have a Bachelor of Commerce (Economics and
            Finance)
            and

                  The Big Five Personality Test offers a concise measure of the five major factors of personality.
                  Scores give a broad global description of an individual compared to the population.

      <div class="row u-margin-bottom-30">
        <h5><strong>Myers-Briggs</strong></h5>
        <p>
          According to a more detailed description of the Myers-Briggs INTJ personality type, the strengths include
          enjoying theoretical and abstract concepts, having high expectations, being a good listener, taking criticism
          well and being confident and hard-working. Weaknesses include being overly analytical and judgemental, being a
          perfectionist, disliking talking about emotions and sometimes being perceived as being insensitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my own perspective I believe that I am a good listener and take criticism well. I believe these are
          important characteristics to have when working closely with other people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do prefer to approach situations logically and analytically rather than emotionally. That isn't to say
          emotions aren't an important consideration, and the feelings of those around me are important.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row u-margin-bottom-30">
        <h5><strong>Learning Style</strong></h5>
        <p>
          There are studies that question the validity of individual learning styles. People learn in a variety of ways
          and what works best can ultimately depend upon the learning objective.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, from my own perspective I prefer to learn by getting invloved, or being hands-on. Being able
          to see the task at hand and engage with it, find out how it works on a fundamental level, give me the most
          satisfaction when learning.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <h5><strong>Big Five Personality Test</strong></h5>
        <p>
          The standouts from the Big Five Personality Test were a high score for Conscientiousness (Work Ethic) and a
          low
          score for Natural Reactions (Neuroticism).
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the result descriptions from <a class="text-link--dark" href="https://www.123test.com/"
            target="_blank">123Test.com</a>, high
          conscientiousness implies discipline, organisation, detailed and a strong sense of duty. High scorers can be
          described as "workaholics".
        </p>
        <p>
          A low score on neuroticism implies being relaxed, resilient and not easily upset in stressful situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my own perspective, I would not necessarily consider myself a workaholic, but I tend to agree with the
          other descriptors. Particularly when it comes to my work I am very organised and prepared. My co-workers would
          vouch for that.

            I remember making a website in primary school as part of our IT class. It was very simple but I really
            enjoyed
            it. I have always tended towards STEM subjects and dabbled in programming.
            After completing a Bachelor of Commerce, I decided to study web development more seriously in my free
            time.
            Once I reached a competent level I joined a web design agency as a web developer. I loved the job and
            loved
            that there was always something new to learn. It was through JavaScript that I started to become more
            interested in programming and software development.

            I choose to come to RMIT and to build a solid foundation on which to launch my career in IT. This course
            will
            help me to develop the practical skills necessary to take on any challenge in any role I end up in. Not to
            mention RMIT’s great reputation for Engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            I expect to learn about the wide variety of opportunities that exist within the world of IT. I’m sure
            there
            are exciting fields that I haven’t even considered yet. I am excited to learn about the fundamentals of
            programming languages. The way humans and computers communicate with one another, and how that
            communication
            has evolved.
            I expect to build the skills necessary to operate in a team environment. The biggest and most exciting
            projects require many hands and I want to work well with my team.

          <h3>Senior Front End Developer @ OurMoneyMarket</h3>
          <h5 class="u-margin-bottom-30">As advertised on <a
              href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50087776?type=standout#searchRequestToken=73d8c6d2-c9c1-4ad1-9439-fe34fcb35f5b"
              target="_blank" class="text-link--dark">Seek.com.au</a></h5>
          <h5><strong>Why this position?</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Many financial institutions have platforms for customer interaction such as websites or apps. This position
            allows me to combine my passion for Web Development with my background in Finance. I really enjoy working
            with JavaScript and using CSS to bring a page to life.
            <br>
            I also like the idea of working on a product that people will actively use and will help them improve their
            lives in some way. Personal finance is important and I like platforms that allow people to take control of
            their situation.
          </p>
          <h5><strong>What is required?</strong></h5>
          <p>
            This role requires a confident and experienced developer to take a lead on the customer facing aspect of
            their platform. There is no business without customers so this is an important position. It also requires
            strong skills with JavaScript, in particular the Angular framework, as well as knowledge of C#.
            <br>
            Experience building out apps or websites with large customer bases is also necessary. The ability to split
            test changes and analyse their effectiveness is important to the role.
          </p>
          <h5><strong>What do I have?</strong></h5>
          <p>
            I have a few years’ experience in Web Development, and am comfortable working with JavaScript and React. I
            haven’t used Angular before but I believe it would be straightforward to learn given my current knowledge
            and experience.
          </p>
          <h5><strong>The plan</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Up until now I have always worked with a graphical designer. I would need to improve my skills with
            Photoshop in order to work with graphics as stated in the job posting.
            <br>
            As I mentioned, I am confident I could pick up Angular in a short time frame. I have used online learning
            resources such as Udemy with success in the past.
            <br>
            I have never worked with C# so I will also need to study that particular language.
            <br>
            Split testing is not something I have much experience with. It might be difficult to gain practical
            experience with this outside of working at a company. Working as a Junior/Mid-Level Developer elsewhere for
            some time could be a path to building more useful skills for this position.
            <br>
            The positing also mentions working with APIs. Although this is advertised as a Front-End Developer position,
            I believe some Back-End knowledge/experience would also be useful.
