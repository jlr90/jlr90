            Hi! My name’s John and I’m from Melbourne, Australia. I have a Bachelor of Commerce (Economics and Finance)
            and am currently undertaking a Bachelor of IT from RMIT University.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to travel and try new experiences. After finishing my first degree, I moved to Japan where I lived
            and worked for five years. I am currently enjoying life back in Australia.
            <br>
            I'm interested in languages and can speak Japanese, Italian, and am currently learning Korean.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been playing guitar for around 18 years, have played in a few rock bands and even recorded an album! I
            also
            enjoy playing tennis and golf when the weather is nice.

        <h5><strong>Myers-Briggs</strong></h5>
        <p>
          According to a more detailed description of the Myers-Briggs INTJ personality type, the strengths include
          enjoying theoretical and abstract concepts, having high expectations, being a good listener, taking criticism
          well and being confident and hard-working. Weaknesses include being overly analytical and judgemental, being a
          perfectionist, disliking talking about emotions and sometimes being perceived as being insensitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my own perspective I believe that I am a good listener and take criticism well. I believe these are
          important characteristics to have when working closely with other people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do prefer to approach situations logically and analytically rather than emotionally. That isn't to say
          emotions aren't an important consideration, and the feelings of those around me are important.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to working in a team, I like to consider everyone's opinion. There may be a good approach that
          hasn't been considered yet. It is also important for me to have clearly defined goals and to be aware of what
          everyone's responsibility is.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row u-margin-bottom-30">
        <h5><strong>Learning Style</strong></h5>
        <p>
          There are studies that question the validity of individual learning styles. People learn in a variety of ways
          and what works best can ultimately depend upon the learning objective.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, from my own perspective I prefer to learn by getting invloved, or being hands-on. Being able
          to see the task at hand and engage with it, and find out how it works on a fundamental level give me the most
          satisfaction when learning.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <h5><strong>Big Five Personality Test</strong></h5>
        <p>
          The standouts from the Big Five Personality Test were a high score for Conscientiousness (Work Ethic) and a
          low score for Natural Reactions (Neuroticism).
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the result descriptions from <a class="text-link--dark" href="https://www.123test.com/"
            target="_blank">123Test.com</a>, high
          conscientiousness implies discipline, organisation, detailed and a strong sense of duty. High scorers can be
          described as "workaholics".
        </p>
        <p>
          A low score for neuroticism implies being relaxed, resilient and not easily upset in stressful situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my own perspective, I would not necessarily consider myself a workaholic, but I tend to agree with the
          other descriptors. Particularly when it comes to my work I am very organised and prepared. My co-workers would
          vouch for that.
          <br>
          I also try to avoid arugments or acting in a way that would increase tension in a group. I believe there is
          usually a reasonable explanation for people's actions and the best way to work through stressful situations is
          through calm discussion.

            I remember making a website in primary school as part of our IT class. It was very simple but I really
            enjoyed the process. I have always tended towards STEM subjects and dabbled in programming on and off over
            the years.
            <br>
            After completing a Bachelor of Commerce, I decided to study web development more seriously in my free time.
            Once I reached a competent level I joined a web design agency as a Web Developer. I loved the job and loved
            that there was always something new to learn. It was through JavaScript that I started to become more
            interested in programming and software development.

            I choose to come to RMIT to build a solid foundation on which to launch my career in IT. This course
            will help me to develop the practical skills necessary to take on any challenge in any role I end up in. Not
            to mention RMIT’s great reputation for Engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            I expect to learn about the wide variety of opportunities that exist within the world of IT. I’m sure there
            are exciting fields that I haven’t even considered yet. I am excited to learn about the fundamentals of
            programming languages. The way humans and computers communicate with one another, how that communication has
            evolved, and what it will look like in the future.
            <br>
            I also expect to build the skills necessary to operate in a team environment. The biggest and most exciting
            projects require many hands and I want to work well with my team.

              href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50087776?type=standout#searchRequestToken=73d8c6d2-c9c1-4ad1-9439-fe34fcb35f5b"
              target="_blank" class="text-link--dark">Seek.com.au</a></h5>
          <h5><strong>Why this position?</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Many financial institutions have platforms for customer interaction such as websites or apps. This position
            allows me to combine my passion for Web Development with my background in Finance. I really enjoy working
            with JavaScript and using CSS to bring websites and web apps to life.
            <br>
            I also like the idea of working on a product that people will actively use and will help them improve their
            lives in some way. Personal finance is important and I like platforms that allow people to take greater
            control over their financial situation.
          </p>
          <h5><strong>What is required?</strong></h5>
          <p>
            This role requires a confident and experienced developer to take a lead on the customer facing aspect of
            their platform. There is no business without customers so this is an important position. It also requires
            strong skills with JavaScript, in particular the Angular framework, advanced CSS techniques, as well as
            knowledge of C#.
            <br>
            Experience building out apps or websites with large customer bases is also necessary. The ability to split
            test changes and analyse their effectiveness is important to the role.
          </p>
          <h5><strong>What do I have?</strong></h5>
          <p>
            I have a few years’ experience in Web Development, and am comfortable working with JavaScript and React. I
            haven’t used Angular before but I believe it would be straightforward to learn given my current knowledge
            and experience.
            <br>
            I am also very comfortable with CSS and am confident I can employ the techniques required to produce an
            elegant finished product.
          </p>
          <h5><strong>The plan</strong></h5>
          <p>
            Up until now I have always worked with a graphical designer. I would need to improve my skills with
            Photoshop in order to work with graphics as stated in the job posting.
            <br>
            As I mentioned, I am confident I could pick up Angular in a short time frame. I have used online learning
            resources such as Udemy with success in the past.
            <br>
            I have never worked with C# so I will also need to study that particular language.
            <br>
            Split testing is not something I have much experience with. It might be difficult to gain practical
            experience with this outside of working at a company. Working as a Junior/Mid-Level Developer elsewhere for
            some time could be a path to building more useful skills for this position.
            <br>
            The positing also mentions working with APIs. Although this is advertised as a Front-End Developer position,
            I believe some Back-End knowledge/experience would also be useful.

          <h5><strong>Overview</strong></h5>
          <p>
            The project is an application which enables Learner Drivers to log their practice time under various
            conditions, keep
            track of what areas need work, and easily view statistics and tips which will enable them to become more
            confident – and importantly – safer drivers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project aims to raise the standard for Australian Learner Drivers. Currently each state has its own
            rules and own requirements for learning to drive. The aim of this project is not to change laws to be
            uniform across the country, but rather to ensure a consistent and clear level of experience and practice
            each learner should achieve before driving on their own.

          <h5><strong>Motivation</strong></h5>
          <p>
            The risk of being involved in a car accident increases significantly once a driver switches from supervised
            driving on their L-Plates, to unsupervised driving on their P-Plates. With more – and importantly better –
            practice, we can reduce this risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to a survey from Roy Morgan research in 2016, 94% of Australians between 14 and 17 years old have
            a smart phone. The typical starting age for Learner Drivers is 16 years old, so it is reasonable to assume
            there is a
            market for this product.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are currently similar apps on the market, however they are only for specific Australian states, vary
            in what they offer the user, and often have poor ratings. Some apps cover local rules, some apps are
            general spreadsheet style log
            books, and some apps offer mock driving tests. None combine all useful features into one convenient app.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was a learner driver, I had to keep a logbook of every trip I took for two years. This was tedious
            and the book was cumbersome to carry around. The app will provide a simple, digital solution, offering more
            functionality and better feedback.

          <h5><strong>Description</strong></h5>
          <p>
            The initial aim is to have the app cover all Australian states and territories. As mentioned, each region
            has its own rules regarding learner drivers. Some of these, such as L-Plate specific speed limits, affect
            drivers from other
            states when they cross the border and may not be known. The app will allow users to select their current
            state or territory and have a relevant ruleset apply to their profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users will need to create an account to get started and keep track of their details and progress. After
            that, information can be gathered automatically, or input manually in an ‘offline’ mode. The user can input
            their target hours before taking the final driving test and months/years until they want to take the test.
            <br>
            The app will calculate recommended driving patterns, offer suggestions, and give reminders to practice
            regularly and in different conditions, all with a basic aim of 120 hours total practice while on L-Plates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the features will rely on the use of the mobile device’s GPS tracking to record information on
            average speed, city driving versus highways, short trips versus long trips, and total kilometres driven. A
            weather API will also need to be used in order to track driving experience in wet and dry conditions. And of
            course, the local date and time will be recorded to keep track of day time versus night time driving
            experience, and total time spent driving.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dashboard page of the app will display current statistics for the user, including total time spent
            driving, total kilometres, total day and night hours and total wet and dry hours. More importantly, it will
            also display recommendations for the user, such as a suggestion to get more practice at night or in wet
            conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For long journeys, the user will be able to ‘plan a trip’. This will include suggested break locations, and
            relevant local rules to consider, such as speed limits in other states, or rules for driving with trams if
            the driver is entering Melbourne.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important consideration is the use of mobile devices while driving. Obviously, I don’t want to
            encourage people to use their phones while driving. There could be a screen-lock feature where you can set
            the app up, hit a ‘start trip’ button, and the app will lock the phone while in use. The advice would be to
            keep the mobile device in the glove compartment or somewhere it won’t be a distraction while driving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Potential difficulties in creating this application could include funding. As there is no clear way to
            monetise the app (other than through potentially annoying advertising) the obvious way would be through
            pitching to relevant government departments for funding.

          <h5><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></h5>
          <p>
            As this is a mobile app, it needs to be developed with both Android and iOS operating systems in mind. While
            it could be developed individually for both, I believe coding at least the basic, minimum viable product, in
            React Native would be the most efficient way to start. This would also allow for the front-end design to be
            put together easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            There would need to be a back-end to handle signing up or logging on, communicating with a weather API,
            possibly communicating with something like Google Maps API, and for managing storage on the user’s device.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the suggestion for the JavaScript library React Native to be used for the front-end, Node.JS is a
            possible pairing for the back-end. Any other common back-end language such as Java or Python could also be
            considered. And of course, SQL for database management of things such as local state or territory rules,
            global statistics and user information.
            <br>
            Information would need to be stored on a server somewhere, potentially AWS.
            Other than the user owning a mobile device, there is no hardware requirement for this project.

          <h5><strong>Skills Required</strong></h5>
          <p>
            The app would not require a particularly advanced skillset to create. There are many developers who would be
            capable of designing and building such an app.
            <br>
            A small team could include a confident JavaScript developer, someone with experience building mobile apps in
            React Native, a designer to consider the best layout and UI/UX, a back-end developer with API experience,
            and maybe someone to look after security or server-side details. Given the app is tracking the user’s
            location and could potentially collect data on regular movement patterns, security is an important
            consideration.

          <h5><strong>Outcome</strong></h5>
          <p>
            A successful outcome would be for local governments to get behind the app and promote it as a useful
            learning tool for learner drivers. Confident and experienced drivers are what make our roads a safer place.
            <br>
            I want the app’s users to be comfortable driving in any condition. Hopefully the app can contribute to
            saving the lives of younger drivers once they are out on their own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Future considerations could include an international version.
